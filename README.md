# scribe-go
Thrift generated go files for Scribe protocol that matches the Thrift version required by https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service project. The Scribe interface is also simplified and does not require `fb303` references.

The go files were generated using a docker image of the Thrift compiler version 0.9.3.
